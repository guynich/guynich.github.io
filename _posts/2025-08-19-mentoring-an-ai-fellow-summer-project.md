Thanks to the [R42 Institute](https://www.r42institute.com/r42-institute-ai-fellows-program) I have enjoyed this volunteer  opportunity.

I’ve appreciated interacting with curious minded folks interested to try new
work.

Whilst it’s been a challenge for the team to get together regularly and talk
things through, I have seen great work and purposeful intent to make new
technology.

This Friday is demo day for the entire cohort and we’ll get to see all the teams
demos. Invitation link below. Good luck to all!
