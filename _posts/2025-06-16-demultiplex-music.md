I just tried an audio demultiplexer ML model.  Amazing how a transformer model
can separate drums, bass, and vocals from a music track! 🎶Not the highest
audio quality but still impressive.

It’s available under the permissive MIT license.

Thanks to Trevor Cox for mentioning it in his CLIP dataset project. More details
in my
[GitHub repo](https://github.com/guynich/demultiplex_music)
for the curious.
