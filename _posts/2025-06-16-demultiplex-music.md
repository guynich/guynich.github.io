I just tried an audio demultiplexer ML model called
[demucs](https://github.com/adefossez/demucs).
Amazing how a transformer model can separate drums, bass, and vocals from a
music track! ðŸŽ¶  Not the highest audio quality but still impressive separation.

Itâ€™s available under the permissive MIT license.

Thanks to Trevor Cox for mentioning it in his CLIP dataset project. More details
in my
[GitHub repo](https://github.com/guynich/demultiplex_music)
for curious experimenters.
